# Connect 2

**Connect 2** is a HTML5 game developed by me back in the 2014 as an attempt to learn more about HTML5, JS in particular, and how all this stuff works together inside an Android app.

The game has been released on December 20th 2014 on Google Play.

## Play

**Connect 2** is meant to be played on mobile devices, but you can play it using Developers Console say in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

## Source

Everything happens in one single JS file with about 600 lines of code.
Some satelite files like index.html and style.css are not worth mentioning.

## Licence

**Connect 2** uses MIT License.
